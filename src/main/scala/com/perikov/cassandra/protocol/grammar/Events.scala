/** An event pushed by the server. A client will only receive events for the
  * types it has REGISTERed to. The body of an EVENT message will start with a
  * [string] representing the event type. The rest of the message depends on the
  * event type.
  * @note
  *   All EVENT messages have a streamId of -1 (Section 2.3).
  *
  * Please note that "NEW_NODE" and "UP" events are sent based on internal
  * Gossip communication and as such may be sent a short delay before the binary
  * protocol server on the newly up node is fully started. Clients are thus
  * advised to wait a short time before trying to connect to the node (1 second
  * should be enough), otherwise they may experience a connection refusal at
  * first.
